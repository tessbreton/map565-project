# MAP565 Time Series Project

In this dissertation, we carry out statistical studies on four different datasets to use the concepts covered in MAP565. 
- The first dataset contains stock price data for NASDAQ companies; we use it to model the Amazon share price with GARCH processes, and then to model the dependence between the Amazon and Google share prices using copulas. 
- The second dataset contains Swiss energy consumption data, which we will analyze using time series theory. 
- The third dataset contains road traffic data (number of vehicles) in Istanbul for the period December 2023. We use a SARIMA model to model their periodic evolution. 
- Finally, the last dataset lists earthquakes in Chile over the last ten years; we use Hawkes processes to model their occurrence.
